Test Research Document

This is a test document for validating the journal functionality in Crush's research mode.

Key Points:
1. The journal tool should automatically save research findings to JOURNAL.md
2. Each entry should be timestamped with the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: Title"
3. New entries should be added at the beginning of the file (reverse chronological order)
4. Entries should be separated by horizontal rules

Research Findings:
- The system uses a special journal tool for saving research
- Research mode is activated with the -r flag
- The journal is mandatory for all research sessions

Conclusion:
The journal system helps maintain a persistent record of all research activities.
